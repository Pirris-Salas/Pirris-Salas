# :costa_rica::recycle::books: Hola I'm Luis Salas
#
I used to work on the tourism industry, but I been always passionated about new technologies since I was a child. 
At my 18 years old I developed my first Android application with Eclipse and Java. Nowadays I'm learning how to move myself to the next level using Flutter and Dart.

PD: Waiting for Fucshia OS, probably it will be my new rocket ship.:rocket:
